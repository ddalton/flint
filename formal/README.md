# Formal model — the replica-lifecycle / writer-set machine

`FlintReplication.tla` models the durability core every flint orchestrator
mutates: leg lifecycle states, the writer set, epoch cuts, raid superblock
generations, the F36c freshness gate, the failure taxonomy the P4 work
made explicit (crash-stop vs **silent omission** vs verified death) — and,
since tranche 2: **hot rejoin** (kept-payload readmission, the shared-base
ancestry check, the Scrub demotion), **torn writes** (crash between
replica write and client ack), and the **F48 zombie head** (a partitioned
server still acking writes until admission severs it).

Run the gate: `scripts/check-tla.sh` (fetches tla2tools.jar on first use).
It runs five configs, ALL required:

1. `FlintReplication.cfg` — the shipped design, 3-leg breadth
   (GateStrict, RejoinGuard, FenceZombie all TRUE): all invariants plus
   post-storm convergence hold. ~44k distinct states, seconds.
2. `FlintReplicationDeep.cfg` — the shipped design, 2 legs at a deeper
   failure budget (3 events) so torn-write divergence and the Scrub
   demotion are actually **reachable** (verified via TLC action coverage:
   every new action fires). Invariants + liveness hold.
3. `FlintReplicationF36c.cfg` — the pre-F36c bug (`GateStrict=FALSE`):
   TLC **must find** an `Inv_NoSilentLoss` violation. The 6-state
   counterexample is the split-lineage loss in its purest form.
4. `FlintReplicationRejoin.cfg` — hot rejoin without the ancestry check
   (`RejoinGuard=FALSE`): TLC **must find** an `Inv_NoDivergentServing`
   violation — a torn write strands a block on one leg, the leg goes
   stale and returns, and an unguarded delta rejoin (union copy — a block
   copy never erases) smuggles the dead-lineage block into a serving
   raid: a split-read surface.
5. `FlintReplicationF48.cfg` — no zombie sever (`FenceZombie=FALSE`):
   TLC **must find** a zombie-head violation — the partitioned old head
   keeps acking client writes after the new assembly serves (silent loss
   and/or split-brain divergence).

Runs 3–5 are the model's own regression tests; a model that cannot
rediscover the bug classes it exists for proves nothing.

## What maps to what

| model | code |
|---|---|
| `writerSet` + stamp/add/remove actions | `replica_sync.rs`: `set_writer_set` / `mark_in_sync` / `mark_stale` / `prune_writers_for_replacement` |
| `Assemble` gate disjunction | `freshness_gate.rs` (`Proceed` / `Defer` / `ServeWithRisk`) |
| `Replace` guard `legUp = "dead"` | `replica_replace.rs::node_gone` (the C2 justification) |
| `raidGen` / `legGen` / `NewestOf` | SPDK raid1 superblock examine (newest incarnation serves) |
| WF on `RaidDeconfigure` | P4 dead-target timeouts (TCP_USER_TIMEOUT + fast_io_fail) |
| WF on `ConfirmDead` | the replace-after / node-gone threshold |
| `HotRejoin` (kept identity + payload) | `hot_rejoin.rs::hot_rejoin_volume` (contrast `Replace`: fresh identity, empty payload) |
| `RejoinGuard` at CatchUp **and** Admit | `catchup.rs`'s "usable shared epoch history" check; re-verified in the admission window |
| `Scrub` + WF on it | the `HotRejoinScrubbed` arm: delta demoted to full rebuild |
| `WriteTorn` | head crash between replica write and client ack |
| `ServerPartition` / `ZombieWrite` / Assemble's sever (`FenceZombie`) | the F48 zombie head; `catchup.rs`'s zombie-consumer sever at admission |
| `lineage` / `Inv_NoDivergentServing` | raid1 serves reads from ANY leg: one phantom block is a split-read surface |
| `Deferred` (liveness escape) | NodeStage's Defer arm: no in-sync material ⇒ designed unavailability, never stale service |
| `Inv_NoSilentLoss` | PacificA's commit invariant; the ledger oracle's zero-loss check is its runtime shadow |

## What the model already caught

- Its **first TLC run** (tranche 1) disproved the author's belief
  (recorded in several code comments) that replacement is the *only*
  writer-set exit — the code's `mark_stale` also removes, and
  `set_writer_set` stamps wholesale at assembly. The model now mirrors
  the real maintenance rules, and the crash-before-stale-mark race they
  leave is shown to be covered by the superblock-generation belt — for
  exactly as long as at least one newer-generation leg attaches, which is
  why the record-level gate exists for the lone-returned-leg case.
- Tranche 2's first deep run forced the convergence property to state a
  design fact that had only lived in prose: when **no up in-sync leg
  exists**, unavailability is the designed outcome (`Deferred`) — the
  F36c choice sacrifices availability, never safety, and the
  stale-only-survivor last resort is a manual runbook, not an automatic
  action.
- The rejoin mutation's 11-state counterexample is a sharper statement of
  *why* the ancestry check exists than any comment: union-copy catch-up
  plus a torn write is already enough to smuggle a dead-lineage block
  into a serving raid — no zombie required.
- The F48 mutation shows gate and fence are **complementary belts**:
  with the fence on, pre-sever zombie writes are safe *because* the
  strict gate forces the zombie's legs (still the recorded writers) into
  the next assembly; each belt alone is insufficient.

## Deliberate scope limits (tranche 3 candidates)

- Epoch chains deeper than one cut (`epochCut` holds only the latest).
- The stale-only-survivor **last resort** as an explicit modeled action
  (today: correctly absent — the code Defers; it is a manual runbook).
- Hot-rejoin's esnap window internals — crash *inside* catch-up/scrub is
  the crash-sweep sim harness's job (`hot_rejoin.rs` tests); here those
  steps are atomic.
- Identity domains (killed at compile time by the newtypes).

The model checks the design, not the Rust. The campaign drills and the
ledger oracle remain the check on the axioms (P4 exists because a
transport assumption, not a design step, was wrong).
