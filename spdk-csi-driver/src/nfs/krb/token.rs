//! RFC 4121 §4.2 per-message tokens: Wrap (TOK_ID `05 04`) and MIC (`04 04`).
//!
//! This is the acceptor side. flint's NFS server is the GSS *acceptor*: it
//! verifies tokens the client (the *initiator*) emitted, and emits tokens of
//! its own. That asymmetry is the whole reason this module exists as a
//! separate layer, because RFC 4121 §2 keys every operation off the sender's
//! role:
//!
//! ```text
//!                     MIC (04 04)          Wrap (05 04)
//!   sender acceptor    23 ACCEPTOR_SIGN     22 ACCEPTOR_SEAL
//!   sender initiator   25 INITIATOR_SIGN    24 INITIATOR_SEAL
//! ```
//!
//! A server therefore *emits* with 22/23 and *verifies* with 24/25. Swapping
//! the pair is the classic bug: it round-trips perfectly against itself —
//! both sides derive the same wrong key — and fails against every real peer.
//! [`Role::seal_usage`] and [`Role::sign_usage`] are the only place the
//! numbers appear, and [`PerMessageTokens`] always asks the *peer's* role for
//! a verify and its *own* role for an emit, so the swap is not expressible.
//!
//! Two further traps, both of which a self-round-trip test sails straight
//! past because the same mistake is made on both sides:
//!
//! * **The header goes at the END of the protected buffer.** §4.2.4 is
//!   `encrypt(plaintext | filler | "header")` and `get_mic(plaintext |
//!   "header")` — data first, header last. This is inverted from nearly every
//!   other protocol and there is no length field to catch it.
//! * **EC and RRC are zeroed in the crypto's copy of the header, but by
//!   different rules that sit one paragraph apart.** With confidentiality
//!   *only RRC* is zeroed and EC keeps its real value; without
//!   confidentiality *both* are zeroed. See [`header_for_seal`] and
//!   [`header_for_sign`].
//!
//! RFC 4121 publishes no test vectors at all — not one hex string beyond the
//! fixed constants — and it cannot, because EC, RRC, the filler octets and
//! the confounder are all sender's choice, so no canonical token exists. The
//! tests below therefore pin this layer three ways: RFC constants and the
//! §4.2.5 rotation semantics directly; the exact buffers handed to the crypto
//! asserted byte-for-byte (that is where the two traps above actually live);
//! and whole tokens against goldens produced by a *separate* implementation
//! written from the RFC text, which was itself first pinned to all 63
//! published RFC 3961/3962/8009 vectors. Those goldens are marked `derived_`,
//! never `rfcNNNN_`, because they are cross-implementation agreement and not
//! IETF-published answers.
