//! RFC 3961 §5.1 n-fold — stretch or shrink an octet string to exactly n bits.
//!
//! n-fold is the single most-misimplemented primitive in Kerberos, and its
//! absence is a shipped defect in this repo: `super::super::kerberos`'s
//! `dr_aes_sha1` ZERO-PADS the 5-octet key-derivation constant to the AES
//! block size where RFC 3961 §5.1 requires `n-fold(Constant)`. Zero-padding
//! `00 00 00 02 AA` gives `00000002AA0000000000000000000000` — a completely
//! different input to E, hence a completely different derived key, hence a
//! cryptosystem no KDC speaks. Every AES key this repo derives is wrong
//! because this function did not exist.
//!
//! The algorithm, from §5.1 (quoting [Blumenthal96] as the RFC does):
//!
//! > To n-fold a number X, replicate the input value to a length that is the
//! > least common multiple of n and the length of X. Before each repetition,
//! > the input is rotated to the right by 13 bit positions. The successive
//! > n-bit chunks are added together using 1's-complement addition (that is,
//! > with end-around carry) to yield a n-bit result.
//!
//! Four traps live in those three sentences, and all four are load-bearing:
//!
//!   1. The rotation is 13 BITS, not 13 bytes, and it is to the RIGHT.
//!   2. It is applied to the m-octet INPUT copy, cumulatively — copy `i` is
//!      the input rotated by `13*i` bits — not to the growing output buffer,
//!      and not re-derived from the original input each time (that would make
//!      every copy after the first identical).
//!   3. Copy 0 is UNROTATED. RFC 3961 A.1 closes with the observable
//!      consequence: "the initial octets exactly match the input string when
//!      the output length is a multiple of the input length."
//!   4. The addition carries END-AROUND. Plain two's-complement addition with
//!      the carry discarded agrees on many inputs — including
//!      64-fold("012345"), the vector everyone quotes — and diverges on
//!      others. That is exactly why the tests below pin all eleven published
//!      vectors and not the famous one.
//!
//! Pinned to all 11 vectors of RFC 3961 Appendix A.1, hex copied from
