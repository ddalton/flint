//! The Kerberos encryption profile: RFC 3961 §5.3 for enctypes 17/18, and
//! the RFC 8009 §5 construction that *replaces* it for enctypes 19/20.
//!
//! Two constructions live here, and they are not variants of one another:
//!
//! * RFC 3961 §5.3 (enctypes 17, 18) — MAC-over-plaintext.
//!   `ciphertext = E(Ke, conf | plaintext | pad) | HMAC(Ki, conf | plaintext | pad)[1..h]`
//! * RFC 8009 §5 (enctypes 19, 20) — encrypt-then-MAC over `IV | C`.
//!   `C = E(Ke, N | plaintext, IV)`, `H = HMAC(Ki, IV | C)`, `ciphertext = C | H[1..h]`
//!
//! RFC 8009 §1 says outright that it does not use the simplified profile,
//! precisely so the receiver can verify integrity *before* decrypting. So a
//! single code path parameterised by "hash function and key size" cannot
//! serve both families — the bytes that go under the MAC differ. They are
//! written out separately below, on purpose.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! [`super::super::kerberos`] encrypts as `AES-CTS(Ke, plaintext | HMAC(Ki,
//! plaintext))`: no confounder, and the MAC *inside* the ciphertext. It also
//! derives Ke with the constant RFC 3961 §5.3 assigns to Kc. Every one of the
//! 55 tests in that file encrypts and decrypts with the same pair of
//! functions, so all of it round-trips and none of it interoperates. A
//! self-consistency test is not evidence of a wire format.
//!
//! Consequently every primitive here carries a KNOWN-ANSWER test with hex
//! copied out of the RFC, and the tests are named for the section they pin.
//! Round-trip tests exist too, but only *in addition*.
//!
//! # What is and is not pinned
//!
//! * AES-CBC-CTS (= SP800-38A CBC-CS3): six ciphertexts **and** six
//!   carried-out IVs, RFC 3962 Appendix B. The non-zero cipher-state path has
//!   no published vector at all and is covered only by the
//!   cross-implementation differential below.
//! * RFC 8009 §5 encrypt/decrypt and §6 checksum: ten known answers, RFC 8009
//!   Appendix A, with the confounder fixed by the RFC.
//! * RFC 3961 §5.3 for enctypes 17/18: **no IETF-published known answer
//!   exists.** RFC 3961 Appendix A is DES/DES3 only; RFC 3962 Appendix B stops
//!   at string-to-key and raw CTS, and a KAT would additionally have to fix
//!   the confounder, which RFC 3962 never does. Three things stand in for it,
//!   and none of them is a KAT:
//!   1. the composition — which octets go under the MAC, and where the tag
//!      lands — asserted byte-for-byte on top of CTS (pinned by RFC 3962
//!      Appendix B) and HMAC-SHA-1 (pinned by RFC 2202, truncation included);
//!   2. a **cross-implementation differential**: ten end-to-end answers for
//!      enctypes 17 and 18 produced by a second, independent implementation
//!      (OpenSSL AES-ECB + Python stdlib HMAC, written from the RFC text and
//!      first verified to reproduce all six RFC 3962 Appendix B and all eight
//!      RFC 8009 Appendix A vectors). Inputs are all RFC-published hex; only
//!      the outputs are generated. See the banner above `k3961_case`;
//!   3. round trips, which prove nothing about the wire format on their own.
//!
//!   Two implementations can share a misreading. Closing the gap for real
//!   needs a capture against a live KDC (`mount -o sec=krb5p` against MIT
//!   krb5, or MIT's `crypto_tests` data), not another test in this file.
//!
//! # Cipher state
//!
//! Every function here starts from the initial (all-zero) cipher state. RFC
//! 4120 EncryptedData and RFC 4121 per-message tokens each encrypt from the
//! initial state, so nothing in flint chains one. RFC 8009 Appendix A notes
//! that *all* its samples use the default cipher state, so the chaining rule
//! has no published vector at all — we expose [`cts_next_iv`] (which RFC 3962
//! Appendix B *does* pin, as "Next IV") but deliberately do not build a
//! stateful encrypt API on top of unverifiable ground.

// Tests. Every hex string below was copied out of the RFC text fetched from
// rfc-editor.org; the CTS and RFC 8009 blocks were extracted from the RFC hex
// dumps mechanically rather than retyped. Test names carry the section they
// pin.
//
// ANTI-VACUITY AUDIT. A green suite is not evidence that the suite can see
// anything, so seven deliberate defects were injected and the suite re-run.
// Each was caught; the counts are the number of tests that went red.
//
//   A  CS1/CS2-style CTS: swap only when there is a ragged tail      8
//   B  RFC 8009 MAC over C instead of IV | C (both sides)           .|
//   C  RFC 3961 MAC over the ciphertext instead of the plaintext    13 (B+C+D)
//   D  trailing h octets of the HMAC instead of the leading ones    .|
//   E  integrity check removed from decrypt                         .|
//   F  confounder left all-zero instead of drawn from the CSPRNG    11 (E+F+G)
//   G  CTS decrypt zero-extends the tail instead of recovering      .|
//      the stolen octets of C_{n-1}
//
// Two results worth keeping: A is invisible to the 17- and 31-octet vectors
// and only the exact-multiple ones (32/48/64) catch it, while G is the
// mirror image — invisible to the exact-multiple vectors, caught only by the
// ragged-tail ones. Both classes are needed; neither alone is a CTS test.
//
// SECOND AUDIT, when the cross-implementation differential below was added.
// Two further defects were injected and the suite re-run:
//
//   H  single-block CTS ignores the IV (the literal RFC 3962 §5 "also        1
//      known as ECB mode" reading, which is only equivalent at a zero IV)
//   I  RFC 3961 §5.3 MACs the ciphertext instead of the plaintext,          12
//      on BOTH sides — the kerberos.rs bug shape, which round-trips
//
// H went red in exactly ONE test: `xcheck_rfc3962_5_cts_with_a_non_zero_
// cipher_state`. Every RFC 3962 Appendix B and RFC 8009 Appendix A vector
// stayed green, because all fourteen of them use the all-zero cipher state.
// That single leg is the only thing in this file standing between the two
// readings of RFC 3962 §5, and it decides for CBC-with-IV, which is what
// RFC 8009 §5's `C = E(Ke, N | plaintext, IV)` requires.
//
// I went red in all ten `xcheck_rfc3961_5_3_*` legs plus the two composition
// tests — and `round_trip_every_enctype_and_length` stayed GREEN, which is
// the whole thesis of this module in one line.
