//! Interop against MIT Kerberos — the gate that vectors cannot close.
//!
//! Every other test in `krb` is pinned to published RFC vectors or to a
//! second implementation written from the RFC text. Both are strong, and
//! neither can prove that a real peer accepts flint's bytes or that
//! flint accepts a real peer's.
//!
//! The fixtures here were produced by MIT krb5's own `libgssapi`
//! (`python3-gssapi`) against a live KDC, in a Lima VM, on 2026-08-27:
//! a real AS-REQ/TGS-REQ for a real service principal, then
//! `gss_init_sec_context`, `gss_get_mic` and `gss_wrap`. flint is the
//! acceptor. If these pass, the ticket path, the key derivation, the
//! RFC 4121 framing and the enctype handling all agree with the
//! reference implementation.
//!
//! Regenerating: see `scratchpad/krb/setup-kdc.sh` and `gen-tokens.py`
//! in the session record — realm FLINT.TEST, one service principal per
//! enctype so each ticket path is exercised.
